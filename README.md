## How to Run

Make sure a recent version of python is installed to your system, and run 'monster_hunter.py'

## What I Learnt

- Effectively using class methods to simplify and condense code
- Making main loop as easy to manage as possible
- Decomposing into multiple simple functions and procedures rather than a few complex ones

## Improvements

- Make a text based interface
  - Text art
  - Curses module
- Graphical user interface
